**Notifications:** Send reminders for next eligible donation dates or blood drives. <br>

**2. Blood Inventory Management** <br>
Blood Stock Monitoring: Real-time tracking of blood types, quantities, and expiration dates. <br>
Blood Bag Labeling: Generate unique identifiers for each blood bag with barcodes/QR codes. <br>
Blood Testing & Classification: Record test results (HIV, Hepatitis, etc.) and classify blood based on quality and type. <br>
Expiry Alerts: Notify admins of nearing expiration dates to minimize wastage. <br>
  
**3. Blood Request and Distribution** <br>
**Patient Requests:** Allow hospitals and individuals to request blood by type and quantity. <br>
**Request Approval:** Review and approve/reject blood requests based on stock availability. <br>

Donor Portal: A dedicated space for donors to register, track their donations, and view eligibility. <br>
Hospital Portal: Allow hospitals to request blood, check status, and track deliveries. <br>
